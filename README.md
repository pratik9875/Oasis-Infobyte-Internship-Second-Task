# 🧑‍💼 Internship Project  
# 👥 Customer Segmentation Analysis  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing customer data** to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes.  
The goal is to help businesses better understand their customer base and design targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions, and loyalty programs.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess customer data for accuracy and consistency.  
- Identify distinct customer groups using data analysis techniques.  
- Analyze customer behavior based on **purchases, frequency, and spending patterns**.  
- Visualize customer segments for better business understanding.  
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention and engagement.

## 🧾 Dataset Description  
The **Customer Dataset** contains information about customers’ transactions, demographics, and engagement behavior.

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Customer_ID** | Unique identifier for each customer |
| **Age** | Age of the customer |
| **Gender** | Gender of the customer |
| **Annual_Income** | Yearly income of the customer |
| **Spending_Score** | Score based on customer spending behavior |
| **Recency** | Days since the last purchase |
| **Frequency** | Number of purchases made |
| **Monetary_Value** | Total amount spent by the customer |
| **Region** | Geographic location of the customer |

> *Note: Columns may differ based on the dataset used.*

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Removed **missing**, **duplicate**, and **irrelevant** records.  
- Handled **outliers** and standardized numerical features.  
- Created new features such as **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values**.  
- Encoded categorical variables for analysis.  
- Scaled numerical data for uniform comparison.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Performed using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to explore and visualize customer behavior:  
- Distribution of **age, gender, and income**.  
- Relationship between **spending score and income**.  
- Clustering visualization (if applicable).  
- Identification of high-value customers.  
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) pattern analysis.

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Identified **customer groups** with high purchase frequency and spending scores.  
- Found **young adults and middle-aged customers** contributing most to total revenue.  
- Discovered that **high-income customers** have varied spending patterns.  
- Segmentation helped in identifying **loyal customers** and **potential churners**.
